# Project Motivation

I developed this website for a group of friends I know who are passionate about **Pokémon collectible cards**.  

Every Sunday, they gather at various flea markets across Lombardy, where they sell cards, meet other collectors and share their enthusiasm for the hobby.

**PokéStorie** was created to represent their community.

---

# Introduction

- Entirely built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- The website includes:

  - Homepage with hero section
  - Shop page with  carousel
  - About page with the story of Pokestorie
  - Google Maps section
  - Login modal with JavaScript interactions
  - Cookie consent popup that appears on page load

- Visual design inspired by Pokémon brand identity:
  - **Navy Blue (#13294B)**
  - **Pokémon Yellow (#FFCB05)**
  - **Turquoise Accent (#00C2B8)**

---

# Homepage

The homepage introduces the user to the site through:

- A large **hero section** with a welcoming message
- A **login button** that opens a custom modal
- A **Best Sellers** grid showing selected cards

The goal is to immediately immerse the visitor in the collecting experience.

# About Page

# Find Us

- A short text box with updated information

# Login Modal

Interactive features include:

- Smooth animations and background blur
- Fully functional form fields (email + password)

# Cookie Banner

- When the page loads for the first time, a **cookie consent banner** appears.
- It informs users that the website uses cookies to improve their experience.
- The banner offers two options:
  - **Accept Cookies**
  - **Reject Cookies**
- User choices are saved using **localStorage**, so:
  - The banner appears only once per user
  - The preference is remembered on the next visits

This improves user transparency and adds a professional touch to the website.

# Technologies Used
